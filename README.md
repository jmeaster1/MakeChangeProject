## Week 1 homework for Skill Distillery

This program calculates the most efficient method of providing change in $USD when given an item cost and an amount tendered. It satisfies all requirements listed below. I have also included $50 bills and $100 bills.

In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed.
